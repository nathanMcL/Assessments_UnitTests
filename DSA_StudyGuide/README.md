# Data Structures and Algorithms Study Guide

- Study Guide... I want to create basic `Data Structure` and `Algorithms` Study Guide...<br>
I am impartial to online coding challenges. As some that I have done seem to vague, feel imcomplete/lack of setup or design, cost moneys for what might not be worth the cost...<br> Sometimes when I do the challenges I can get the single entry accepted, but I have been having issue with getting all test cases accepted. In my most recent online coding challenges I could not debug why I was only getting 9 out of 15 test cases accepted. There was no terminal available to display the debugging message... <br> 
So, I am wanting to create a set of data structures and algorithms related programs that will simulate multiple test cases that the program has to check... In my timed online challenge, I tried two, three methods, went back to one because it recieved the highest test case acceptance `9/15`...<br>
I don't like not knowing, and now I must do this ðŸ¤¨... <br>

## Array

An `Array` is a linear data structure consisting of a collection of elements `[...]`, where each element is identified by its index. <br>
`Arrays` store elements of the same data type in adjacent memory locations, enabling efficient random access. <br>

Using these test files: <br>
`array_Pokemon_input.txt` <br>
`array_Emoji_input.txt` <br>
Located in this sub-directory: <br>
`myAssessment\DSA_StudyGuide\DSA_Text_files\array_testFile_input.txt` <br>
Using this Python script: <br>
`Array.py` <br>

... Make me Understand...ðŸ™ƒ<br>

### Big`O` Runtime

```
Operation:	Time Complexity:  Explain:  
Access	      O(1)            It is `Constant time`, as the `array` is indexed.
Search	      O(n)            It is `Linear time`, because every `[element]` must be checked.
Insertion	    O(n)            This requires shifting elements, making the complexity `O(n)`.
Deletion	    O(n)            Also requires shifting elements, making the complexity `O(n)`.
```
<br>

### Use Cases:   <br>

- Efficient to Random Access: Ideal when the position of elements is known and frequently accessed. <br>
- Storing Data (Uniformed, Consistent, Similar): For fixed-size datasets like game character stats, emoji collections, or leaderboard scores. <br>
- Visual Representations: `Arrays` are useful for static lists that are displayed in user interfaces. <br>
