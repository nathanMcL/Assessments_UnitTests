# Data Structures and Algorithms Study Guide

I want to create a basic Data Structures and Algorithms study guide. ðŸ˜„ <br>

Online coding challenges can be frustratingâ€”sometimes they feel vague, incomplete, or poorly designed. On top of that, some require payment without much assurance of value. In my recent experience, I managed to pass single test cases but struggled to get all test cases accepted. For one challenge, I hit a wall with 9 out of 15 test cases passing. No terminal, no debugging toolsâ€”just me and a lot of guessing. ðŸ¥´ <br>

So, Iâ€™ve decided to tackle this head-on! This study guide will include programs that simulate multiple test cases to build a deeper understanding of data structures and algorithms. My goal is to not just solve problems but also to understand why certain methods work better than others. Itâ€™s time to ditch the uncertainty. Letâ€™s do this! ðŸ¤“ðŸ’ª <br>

## Set Up

Using these test files: <br>
`array_Pokemon_input.txt` <br>
`array_Emoji_input.txt` <br>
Located in this sub-directory: <br>
`myAssessment\DSA_StudyGuide\DSA_Text_files\array_testFile_input.txt` <br>
Using the Python scripts: <br>
`Array.py` <br>

## `Array.py`

An `Array` is a linear data structure consisting of a collection of elements `[...]`, where each element is identified by its index. <br>
`Arrays` store elements of the same data type in adjacent memory locations, enabling efficient random access. <br>

### Big`O` Runtime

```
Operation:	Time Complexity:  Explain:  
Access	          O(1)            It is `Constant time`, as the `array` is indexed.
Search	          O(n)            It is `Linear time`, because every `[element]` must be checked.
Insertion	    O(n)            This requires shifting elements, making the complexity `O(n)`.
Deletion	    O(n)            Also requires shifting elements, making the complexity `O(n)`.
```
<br>

### Use Cases:   <br>

- Efficient to Random Access: Ideal when the position of elements is known and frequently accessed. <br>
- Storing Data (Uniformed, Consistent, Similar): For fixed-size datasets like game character stats, emoji collections, or leaderboard scores. <br>
- Visual Representations: `Arrays` are useful for static lists that are displayed in user interfaces. <br>
