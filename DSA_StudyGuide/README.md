# Data Structures and Algorithms Study Guide

I want to create a basic Data Structures and Algorithms study guide. ðŸ˜„ <br>

Online coding challenges can be frustratingâ€”sometimes they feel vague, incomplete, or poorly designed. On top of that, some require payment without much assurance of value. In my recent experience, I managed to pass single test cases but struggled to get all test cases accepted. For one challenge, I hit a wall with 9 out of 15 test cases passing. No terminal, no debugging toolsâ€”just me and a lot of guessing. ðŸ¥´ <br>

So, Iâ€™ve decided to tackle this head-on! This study guide will include programs that simulate multiple test cases to build a deeper understanding of data structures and algorithms. My goal is to not just solve problems but also to understand why certain methods work better than others. Itâ€™s time to ditch the uncertainty. Letâ€™s do this! ðŸ¤“ðŸ’ª <br>

## Set Up

Using these test files: <br>
`array_Pokemon_input.txt` <br>
`array_Emoji_input.txt` <br>
Located in this sub-directory: <br>
`myAssessment\DSA_StudyGuide\DSA_Text_files\array_testFile_input.txt` <br>
Using the Python scripts: <br>
`Array.py` <br>

## `Array.py`

An `Array` is a linear data structure consisting of a collection of elements `[...]`, where each element is identified by its index. <br>
`Arrays` store elements of the same data type in adjacent memory locations, enabling efficient random access. <br>


... Make me Understand...ðŸ™ƒ<br>

First we want to be able to `access` the test files. <br>

```
### Read the array data from the test files 
def read_array_file(file_path, pattern_to_exclude):
    try:
        with open(file_path, 'r') as file:
            lines = file.readlines()
            # Use regex to exclude lines that are not character names (Section headers)
            return [line.strip() for line in lines if not re.match(pattern_to_exclude, line.strip())]    
    except FileNotFoundError:
        print(f"Error: File at {file_path} not found.")
        return []
```

...Next... <br>
We have to know what it is that we are wanting to do... <br>
Do we want to: <br>

1. `insert` `Charmander` into the first index position `0`of the `array_Pokemon_input` test file: Insert `Charmander` at position `0`. <br>

- What then Happens to `Pikachu`? <br>
 No worries, `Pikachu` will be moved to index `1`, and all subsequent elements will shift. <br>

- Do `Charmander` and `Pikachu` swap locations?<br>
No, `Charmander` is inserted at index `0`, and the rest of the array is shifted.

- If `Charmander` were a new entry to the test file at `index` `0`, would `Pikachu` be shuffled lower on the list?<br>

```
pokemon_array.insert(0, "Charmander")
    print(f"After inserting 'Charmander' at index 0: {pokemon_array}\n")
```

2. `remove` `Charmander`: Delete the first occurrence of `Charmander`. <br>

```
if "Charmander" in pokemon_array:
        pokemon_array.remove("Charmander")
        print(f"After removing 'Charmander': {pokemon_array}\n")
    else:
        print("'Charmander' not found in the array.")
```

3. `append e`: Insert `Charmander` at the Top of the PokÃ©mon OGs list. <br>

```
pokemon_array.append("Charmander")
    print(f"After appending 'Charmander': {pokemon_array}\n")
```

4. `sort`: Sort the PokÃ©mon OGs list alphabetically. <br>

```
pokemon_array.sort()
    print(f"After sorting alphabetically: {pokemon_array}\n")
```

5. `pop`: Pop the last element from the new sorted PokÃ©mon OGs list and print the character name. <br>

```
popped_element = pokemon_array.pop()
    print(f"Popped Element: {popped_element}")
    print(f"Array after popping the last element: {pokemon_array}\n")
```

6. `reverse`: Return the list back to its original order. <br>

```
pokemon_array.reverse()
    print(f"After reversing: {pokemon_array}\n")
    print(f"\n")
```

7. `restore`: Restore the original order of the PokÃ©mon array <br>

This is not a necessary step. I added it because, what if a mistake was made along the way and it would be best to start over. <br>
How could I do that.?. <br>
Basically we are dynamically saving the current state of the `PokÃ©mon array` in temporary memory when it creates the copy. <br>
I wouldn't consider this a `Data Structure` "Topic". I wanted to know what would have to happen...<br>

- Lines: `36/37` <br>

```
# Save the original order of the PokÃ©mon array test file.
    original_pokemon_array = pokemon_array.copy()
```

- Lines: `125/126`<br>

```
# 7. Restore the original order of the PokÃ©mon array
pokemon_array = original_pokemon_array
    print(f"Restored to original order: {pokemon_array}\n")
```

Permanently save the changes or restore the file to its original state after program execution. We are `writing back` to the file. <br>

- Lines: `128/132` <br>

```
# Optional: Write the original array back to the file after all manipulations are done.
    # This can be commented out. Purely Optional.
    with open(pokemon_filepath, 'w') as file:
        file.write('\n'.join(original_pokemon_array))
    print(f"Original order saved back to the file: {pokemon_filepath}")
```


### Big`O` Runtime

```
Operation:	Time Complexity:  Explain:  
Access	      O(1)            It is `Constant time`, as the `array` is indexed.
Search	      O(n)            It is `Linear time`, because every `[element]` must be checked.
Insertion	  O(n)            This requires shifting elements, making the complexity `O(n)`.
Deletion	  O(n)            Also requires shifting elements, making the complexity `O(n)`.
```
<br>

### Use Cases:   <br>

- Efficient to Random Access: Ideal when the position of elements is known and frequently accessed. <br>
- Storing Data (Uniformed, Consistent, Similar): For fixed-size datasets like game character stats, emoji collections, or leaderboard scores. <br>
- Visual Representations: `Arrays` are useful for static lists that are displayed in user interfaces. <br>
