# Data Structures and Algorithms Study Guide

I want to create a basic Data Structures and Algorithms study guide. ðŸ˜„ <br>

Online coding challenges can be frustratingâ€”sometimes they feel vague, incomplete, or poorly designed. On top of that, some require payment without much assurance of value.<br>
In my recent experience, I managed to pass single test cases but struggled to get all test cases accepted. <br>
For one challenge, I hit a wall with 9 out of 15 test cases passing. No terminal, no debugging toolsâ€”just me and a lot of guessing. ðŸ¥´ <br>

So, Iâ€™ve decided to tackle this head-on! This study guide will include programs that simulate multiple test cases to build a deeper understanding of data structures and algorithms. <br>
My goal is to not just solve problems but also to understand why certain methods work better than others. <br>
Itâ€™s time to ditch the uncertainty. Letâ€™s do this! ðŸ¤“ðŸ’ª <br>

## Set Up

Using test_text.txt type files: <br>
`array_Pokemon_input.txt` <br>
`array_Emoji_input.txt` <br>

Located in this sub-directory: <br>
`DSA_StudyGuide\DSA_Text_files\array_testFile_input.txt` <br>

Using Python coded scripts: <br>
`PokemonArray_ListManipulation.py` <br>
`Linked_Lists.py` <br>
(Located in their desginated folder) <br>

---

1. **Arrays**: `List Manipulation` <br>
2. **Linked Lists**:  `Merging`, `Reverseing`, & `Comparing` <br>
3. **Tree Search Algorithms**: `Depth First Search (DFS)`, `Breadth-First Search (BFS)`, `Tree`, `Binary Tree`, `Binary Search Tree`, `Red-Black Tree Search`<br>
